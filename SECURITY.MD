* SECURITY

🛡 Security Policy

Ensuring security is a top priority in Odyssey, especially with blockchain transactions and in-game economies.

🔒 Reporting a Vulnerability

. If you discover a security issue, please do not open a public GitHub issue. Instead, follow these steps:

. Email us at OdysseyProject1@outlook.com (or another contact method such as a dm on twitter @ProjOdyssey)

. Provide a detailed report including steps to reproduce.

. We will respond within 48 hours and work on a fix promptly.

🔐 Security Best Practices

. Blockchain Transactions: All Solana transactions must be signed, verified, and tested before deployment.

. Smart Contract Audits: We conduct audits before deploying major updates.

. User Data Protection: All player accounts and wallets must follow encryption best practices.

. DDoS & Exploit Mitigation: Network and multiplayer traffic should be monitored and rate-limited to prevent abuse.

. Bug Bounty Program: Contributors who report critical security flaws may be eligible for a reward.

Thank you for helping keep Odyssey secure and innovative! 🚀
